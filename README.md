This project implements a single-cycle datapath for the RV32I subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture using SystemVerilog. It includes essential datapath components such as the ALU, register file, instruction memory, control unit, and immediate generator. The repo also features a suite of testbenches for verifying the correctness of individual instructions and datapath behavior.
